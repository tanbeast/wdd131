            <h2>D&C 121:34-40</h2>
            <p>34 Behold, there are many called, but few are chosen. And why are they not chosen?

                35 Because their hearts are set so much upon the things of this world, and aspire to the honors of men, that they do not learn this one lessonâ€”
                
                36 That the rights of the priesthood are inseparably connected with the powers of heaven, and that the powers of heaven cannot be controlled nor handled only upon the principles of righteousness.
                
                37 That they may be conferred upon us, it is true; but when we undertake to cover our sins, or to gratify our pride, our vain ambition, or to exercise control or dominion or compulsion upon the souls of the children of men, in any degree of unrighteousness, behold, the heavens withdraw themselves; the Spirit of the Lord is grieved; and when it is withdrawn, Amen to the priesthood or the authority of that man.
                
                38 Behold, ere he is aware, he is left unto himself, to kick against the pricks, to persecute the saints, and to fight against God.
                
                39 We have learned by sad experience that it is the nature and disposition of almost all men, as soon as they get a little authority, as they suppose, they will immediately begin to exercise unrighteous dominion.
                
                40 Hence many are called, but few are chosen.</p>
